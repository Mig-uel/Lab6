I decided to use NY crime statistics for my data report. I extracted column 4 and 9 to link the type of crime to its borough. If I had more knowledge, I would have averaged out the crimes committed in each borough.

In the terminal session, I was trying to extract both columns and output them to a new CSV file. However,  some of the data became corrupted and I did not know how to fix it.

I created the bash file so that one can simply do ./Extract and it would run the script.
